# Fizzbuzz_JS


In this challenge I have Test-Driven in Javascript using the Jasmine framework. It returns 'Java' if a number passed is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if divisible by 5 and 'JavaBuzz' if the number is both divisible by 3 & 5.

## Installation

Git clone the repository 

```bash
https://github.com/florence-bain/fizzbuzz_JS.git
```

## Usage

```python
import Jasmine following the instructions. 
```
```bash
https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine
```
Once installed run the command `open SpecRunner.html` and open the console through the Developer Tools. You will need to start by initialise an instance of Javabuzz();

`const javabuzz = new Javabuzz();`

Then start inputting some numbers:

`>  javabuzz.says(3)
<- "Java"`

`>  javabuzz.says(5)
<- "Buzz"`

`>  javabuzz.says(15)
<- "Javabuzz"`

`>  javabuzz.says(2)
<- 2`

```
